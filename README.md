A simple node.js web application that can records your exercise routine. Pretty lame to be honest, but this project aimed to learn MERN, a lightweight but powerful web framework.

## Run this project

In the project directory, you can run `npm start` to run the app in the development mode. Then Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser. However, you will not be able to connect to my MongoDB. You will need to create your own MongoDB and input necessary config in .env file inside backend folder.
